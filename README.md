# Implement-neural-network-using-perceptron-and-AdalineGD
The Perceptron algorithm is the simplest type of artificial neural network.

It is a model of a single neuron that can be used for two-class classification problems and provides the foundation 
for later developing much larger networks.

In this exercise, I try to implement the Perceptron algorithm from scratch with Python.


How to train the network weights for the Perceptron.
How to make predictions with the Perceptron.
How to implement the Perceptron algorithm for a real-world classification problem.
Discover how to code ML algorithms from scratch including kNN, decision trees, neural nets, ensembles and much more ,
with full Python code and no fancy libraries.
